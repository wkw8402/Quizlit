# QuizLit: Quizlet from Temu

## Overview

**QuizLit** is an interactive learning tool designed to help users study Korean through a quizlet-like format. Users can add days and items (words) to their study list. Each item consists of an English word and its Korean translation. The app allows users to hide or reveal the Korean translation and mark items as studied when they feel confident with the word.

- **Progress Tracking:** Select items to mark them as studied.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with React, utilizing components, event handlers, useState, and props.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Core framework for building the user interface.
- **React Router DOM:** For navigating between different pages of the application.
- **JSON Server:** To provide a simple REST API for storing study items.
- **TypeScript:** Some parts of the codebase have been migrated to TypeScript for type safety.
- **Custom Hooks:** For managing state and effects.
- **Fetch API:** For making HTTP requests to the JSON server.
- **useState, useEffect, useNavigate:** Core React hooks for managing component state and side effects.
